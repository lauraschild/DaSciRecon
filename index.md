## Thanks for your interest!

Thanks for scanning the QR-code and wanting to find out more about my current project. On here I have added some more details about selected Methods and Results and included references as well as data sources. There is also a link to my AWI page with all my contact details.
I'll keep this page up for the duration of the PhD Days, but feel free to contact me if you ...

## About me
I'm Laura Schild a
- Data Scientist

and
- Conservation Biologist  
I'm doing my PhD in the working groups for High-Latitude Vegetation Change and Earth System Diagnostics in the Section for **Polar Terrestrial Environmental Systems** at the AWI branch in Potsdam. I'm interested in vegetation and climate variability and stability, and how we can use data science to investigate them.
